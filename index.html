The third season of That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime will premiere in the spring of 2024, according to information that was made public on February 22, 2023. The first announcement of this information came during a franchise celebration marking its tenth anniversary, during which the movie That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime: Scarlet Bond was shown for the last time in theaters. A revised release schedule, with an April 2024 premiere date, was unveiled in a new trailer in December 2023. There are rumors that the season will be divided into two courses, or halves.</i></p>
